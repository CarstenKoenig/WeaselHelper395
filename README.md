# WeaselHelper395

Project trying to follow @pro_cessor's three universal rules for good code: 

Rule A: Good names
Rule Alpha: Many small units
Rule Aleph: Tests

The rules aren't ordinal (hence a-aleph), but interact. Small units are easy to name and test. Good names favor small units. They work in every language.



Can't start Project.
Still thinking about a good name...



Call it a weasel, rename it later. Just make sure to keep everything small, and decomposed, but composable.
